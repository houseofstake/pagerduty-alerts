# NEAR PagerDuty Alert Configuration
#
# This file configures which blockchain actions trigger PagerDuty alerts.
# Uses the neardata WebSocket stream (wss://actions.near.stream/ws).
#
# Copy this file to config.yaml and customize for your needs.

# Your PagerDuty Events API v2 integration key
# Get this from: PagerDuty → Services → Your Service → Integrations → Events API V2
# You can either set it here OR use the PAGERDUTY_ROUTING_KEY environment variable
# (recommended: leave this commented/empty and use env var for security)
# pagerduty_routing_key: "YOUR_PAGERDUTY_ROUTING_KEY_HERE"

# Reconnection delay when WebSocket disconnects (seconds)
reconnect_delay_secs: 5

# Event subscriptions - each triggers PagerDuty alerts when matching actions occur
